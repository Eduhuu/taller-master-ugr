# Master of the Universe Level Exercise

Welcome to the Master of the Universe level! This expert-level exercise focuses on repository security, branch protection rules, and professional best practices including GPG signing for verified commits.

## Exercise - Branch Protection Rules and Security Best Practices (GPG Signing & Sensitive Data Management)
**Objective**: Implement enterprise-grade branch protection rules and security best practices including GPG-signed verified commits and secure data management.

**Tasks**:

### Part 1: Set Up Branch Protection Rules on GitHub
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule
3. Configure protection for the `main` branch:
   * Branch name pattern: `main`
   * ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   * ✅ Require approvals (at least 1)
   * ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   * ✅ Require review from Code Owners (reference the existing CODEOWNERS file)
   * ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   * ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   * ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   * ✅ Require signed commits (for master-of-the-universe level)
   * ✅ Include administrators (enforce rules on admins too)

4. Review the existing `CODEOWNERS` file in the repository root
5. Understand how code owners are automatically requested for review on PRs

### Part 2: Test Protected Branch Workflow
1. Try to push directly to main (should be blocked if protections are configured on GitHub):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   echo "test" > direct-push.txt
   git add direct-push.txt
   git commit -m "Attempting direct push"
   git push origin main  # This should fail if protections are active!
   ```

2. Proper workflow - create a feature branch and PR:
   ```bash
   git checkout master-of-the-universe
   git checkout -b feature/protected-workflow
   echo "Proper workflow following branch protection" > workflow.txt
   git add workflow.txt
   git commit -S -m "feat: Add workflow documentation"
   git push origin feature/protected-workflow
   ```

3. On GitHub:
   * Create a Pull Request to main
   * Note the required reviews and checks
   * Observe code owner review requests
   * Document the protection rules in action

### Part 3: Set Up GPG Commit Signing for Verified Commits
1. Generate a GPG key:
   * Follow: [Generate GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   # Choose: RSA and RSA, 4096 bits, no expiration (or set expiration)
   # Enter your name and email (must match GitHub email)
   ```

2. List your GPG keys:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
   ```

3. Export your GPG public key:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID
   ```

4. Add GPG key to GitHub:
   * Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New GPG key
   * Paste your public key
   * [Add GPG key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

5. Configure Git to use your GPG key:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```
   * [Tell Git about signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

6. Associate email with GPG key:
   * [Associate email with GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/associating-an-email-with-your-gpg-key)

7. Make several signed commits:
   ```bash
   echo "Signed commit test 1" > signed-1.txt
   git add signed-1.txt
   git commit -S -m "feat: Add first signed commit"
   
   echo "Signed commit test 2" > signed-2.txt
   git add signed-2.txt
   git commit -S -m "feat: Add second signed commit"
   
   git log --show-signature -2
   ```

8. Push and verify on GitHub (should show "Verified" badge on each commit)

### Part 4: Managing Sensitive Data Securely
1. **Prevention** - Review and enhance `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   # Ensure .gitignore includes common sensitive patterns:
   # .env files
   # API keys
   # Credentials
   # Private keys (.key, .pem files)
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Detection** - Scan for potential secrets in repository history:
   ```bash
   # Check for sensitive patterns in commit history
   git log -p | grep -i "password\|api_key\|secret\|token" | head -20
   
   # Check for large files that might contain sensitive data
   git rev-list --objects --all | \
     git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | \
     sed -n 's/^blob //p' | \
     sort --numeric-sort --key=2 | \
     tail -n 10
   ```

3. **Understanding Remediation** - Know how to remove sensitive data if found:
   * Research `git-filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`
   * Understand the implications of rewriting history
   * Know when to rotate credentials vs. removing from history
   * Document the process even if not performing it

4. **GitHub Security Features** - Enable on your repository:
   * Navigate to Settings → Code security and analysis
   * Review available features:
     - Dependency graph
     - Dependabot alerts
     - Dependabot security updates
     - Secret scanning (if available)
     - Code scanning
   * Enable what's available for your repository

### Part 5: Security Audit and Best Practices
1. Conduct a security review:
   * Audit current repository for security issues
   * Document any findings
   * Review all commits for verification status
   * Check protection rules are working as expected

2. Document security best practices:
   * Why GPG signing prevents impersonation
   * How branch protection supports code quality
   * Why sensitive data should never be committed
   * Best practices for secret management (environment variables, secret vaults)
   * Security in CI/CD pipelines

**Success Criteria**:
- You have configured branch protection rules on GitHub for the main branch
- You understand how CODEOWNERS work and when they're triggered
- You can demonstrate the difference between protected and unprotected workflows
- All your commits are GPG signed and show "Verified" badge on GitHub
- You have configured automatic commit signing in Git
- You have a comprehensive `.gitignore` file preventing sensitive data commits
- You can identify sensitive patterns in repository history
- You understand how to remove sensitive data from Git history (process, not necessarily execution)
- You know when to rotate credentials vs. attempting history cleanup
- Repository security features are enabled where available
- You can articulate security best practices for professional team environments

## 🤖 Using GenAI Tools to Accelerate Your Learning

### Recommended Approach

#### ✅ Good Uses of AI

- **Explaining concepts**: Ask AI to explain what a command does and why
- **Debugging errors**: Share error messages to understand what went wrong
- **Exploring alternatives**: "What's the difference between rebase and merge?"
- **Reviewing your work**: Ask AI to review your git log and suggest improvements
- **Learning best practices**: "What's a good commit message format?"
- **Understanding documentation**: Have AI explain complex Git documentation

#### ❌ Avoid These Pitfalls

- Copying commands without understanding them
- Having AI complete entire exercises without your participation
- Submitting AI-generated reflections as your own thoughts
- Using AI to skip the learning process entirely
